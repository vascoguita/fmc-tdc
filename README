Introduction
---

In electronic instrumentation and signal processing, a time to digital con-
verter (abbreviated TDC) is a device for recognizing events and providing
a digital representation of the time they occurred. At this case, the FMC
TDC outputs the time of arrival for each incoming pulse.

This is the project to provide support of the FMC TDC board in the
Linux kernel plugged to a SPEC carrier board.

The project's aim is to provide an loadable module to be used along with this
board for the latest Linux kernel versions. The driver relies on ZIO frame-
work and the FMC bus dependencies, which are other projects hosted in
OHWR.

This version is known to compile and run with kernels 3.3 onwards.
