<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;TIMEGRP &quot;acam_refclk_i&quot; OFFSET = IN 6 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;tdc_clk_p_i&quot;;&gt; [syn_tdc.pcf(11480)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="new" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.
