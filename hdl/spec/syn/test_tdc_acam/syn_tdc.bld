WARNING:NgdBuild:931 - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance
   'gnum_interface_block.cmp_clk_in.rx_pll_adv_inst' of type PLL_ADV has been
   changed from 'VIRTEX5' to 'SPARTAN6' to correct post-ngdbuild and timing
   simulation for this primitive.  In order for functional simulation to be
   correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in this same manner in the
   source netlist or constraint file.
