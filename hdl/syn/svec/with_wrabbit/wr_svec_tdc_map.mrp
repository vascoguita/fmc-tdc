Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                    3,592 out of  46,076    7%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       20,492
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         9,641 out of  20,492   47%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           1,223 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
