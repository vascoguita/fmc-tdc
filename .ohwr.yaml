    The FMC TDC 1ns 5cha Time to Digital Converter mezzanine board houses 5 input channels. It can calculate time
    differences between pulses arriving to the channels with a precision of Â±700 ps.
    
    It can be carried by any of the carrier boards: [SPEC]({{< ref "/projects/spec" >}}) or
    [SVEC]({{< ref "/projects/svec" >}}). It is implemented using a dedicated time-to-digital converter chip from
    the European company [ACAM](http://www.acam.de/index.php?id=22&L=0).
